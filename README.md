# Purpose
Purpose of this is to implement explainability related stuff as clearly as possible.  Ideally will be able to use torch+tensorflow but initially will just focus on torch.  This library should be useable irl for explainability related tasks but as the focus is on clarity and not speed it may not be the most ideal in all cases.

# Intend to Implement

- TCAV
- Integrated Gradients
- GradCAM
- webserver to display some of these!
